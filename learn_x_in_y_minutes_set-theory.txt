What is Set theory?¬Set theory is a branch of mathematics that studies sets, their operations, and their properties.
What is a set?¬A set is a collection of disjoint items.

What does `:` mean?¬Such that
What is the symbol for the membership qualifier?¬`∈`

What are some examples of Canonical sets?¬The empty set, the set of all natural numbers, the set of all integers, the set of all rational numbers, and the set of all real numbers.
What is the symbol for the empty set, i.e. the set containing no items?¬`∅`
What is the symbol for the set of all natural numbers?¬`ℕ`
What is the symbol for the set of all integers?¬`ℤ`
What is the symbol for the set of all rational numbers?¬`ℚ`
What is the symbol for the set of all real numbers?¬`ℝ`
What are some caveats with respect to canonical sets?¬"
<ol align=""left"">
    <li>Even though the empty set contains no items, the empty set is a subset of itself (and indeed every other set);</li>
    <li>Mathematicians generally do not universally agree on whether zero is a natural number, and textbooks will typically explicitly state whether or not the author considers zero to be a natural number.</li>
</ol>
"
What is Cardinality?¬"The cardinality, or size, of a set is determined by the number of items in the set. The cardinality operator is given by a double pipe, `|...|`.

For example, if `S = { 1, 2, 4 }`, then `|S| = 3`."
What is the Empty Set?¬"<ul align=""left"">
    <li>The empty set can be constructed in set builder notation using impossible conditions, e.g. `∅ = { x : x ≠ x }`, or `∅ = { x : x ∈ N, x < 0 }`;</li>
    <li>the empty set is always unique (i.e. there is one and only one empty set);</li>
    <li>the empty set is a subset of all sets;</li>
    <li>the cardinality of the empty set is 0, i.e. `|∅| = 0`.</li>
</ul>"
What are the ways of representing sets?¬Using literal Sets and Set builder notation
What are literal Sets?¬"A set can be constructed literally by supplying a complete list of objects contained in the set. For example, `S = { a, b, c, d }`.

Long lists may be shortened with ellipses as long as the context is clear. For example, `E = { 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }` is clearly the set of all even numbers, containing an infinite number of objects, even though we've only explicitly written four of them."
What is Set Builder notation?¬"Set builder notation is a more descriptive way of constructing a set. It relies on a _subject_ and a _predicate_ such that `S = { subject : predicate }`. For example,

```
A = { x : x is a vowel } = { a, e, i, o, u, y}
B = { x : x ∈ N, x < 10 } = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
C = { x : x = 2k, k ∈ N } = { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }
```

Sometimes the predicate may ""leak"" into the subject, e.g.

```
D = { 2x : x ∈ N } = { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }
```

What are some types or relations?¬Memberships & equalities
What is a membership?¬"<ul align=""left"">
    <li>If the value `a` is contained in the set `A`, then we say `a` belongs to `A` and represent this symbolically as `a ∈ A`.</li>
    <li>If the value `a` is not contained in the set `A`, then we say `a` does not belong to `A` and represent this symbolically as `a ∉ A`.</li>
</ul>"
What is an equality?¬"<ul align=""left"">
    <li>If two sets contain the same items then we say the sets are equal, e.g. `A = B`.</li>
    <li>Order does not matter when determining set equality, e.g. `{ 1, 2, 3, 4 } = { 2, 3, 1, 4 }`.</li>
    <li>Sets are disjoint, meaning elements cannot be repeated, e.g. `{ 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2 } = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }`.</li>
    <li>Two sets `A` and `B` are equal if and only if `A ⊆ B` and `B ⊆ A`.</li>
</ul>"
What is an example of a special set?¬The Power Set
What is the Power Set?¬"<ul align=""left"">
    <li>Let `A` be any set. The set that contains all possible subsets of `A` is called a ""power set"" and is written as `P(A)`. If the set `A` contains `n` elements, then `P(A)` contains `2^n` elements.</li>
</ul>

```
P(A) = { x : x ⊆ A }
```

What are some examples of Set operations among two sets?¬Union, Intersection, Difference, Symmetrical difference and Cartesian product
What is the Union among two sets?¬"
Given two sets `A` and `B`, the union of the two sets are the items that appear in either `A` or `B`, written as `A ∪ B`.

```
A ∪ B = { x : x ∈ A ∪ x ∈ B }
```
"
What is the Intersection among two sets?¬"
Given two sets `A` and `B`, the intersection of the two sets are the items that appear in both `A` and `B`, written as `A ∩ B`.

```
A ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A, x ∈ B }
```
"
What is the Difference among two sets?¬"
Given two sets `A` and `B`, the set difference of `A` with `B` is every item in `A` that does not belong to `B`.

```
A \ B = { x : x ∈ A, x ∉ B }
```
"
What is the Symmetrical difference among two sets?¬"
Given two sets `A` and `B`, the symmetrical difference is all items among `A` and `B` that doesn't appear in their intersections.

```
A △ B = { x : ((x ∈ A) ∩ (x ∉ B)) ∪ ((x ∈ B) ∩ (x ∉ A)) }

A △ B = (A \ B) ∪ (B \ A)
```
"
What is the Cartesian product among two sets?¬"
Given two sets `A` and `B`, the cartesian product between `A` and `B` consists of a set containing all combinations of items of `A` and `B`.

```
A × B = { (x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B }
```
