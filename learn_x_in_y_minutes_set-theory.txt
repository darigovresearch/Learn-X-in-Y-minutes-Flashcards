What are some caveats with respect to canonical sets? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"
<ol align=""left"">
    <li>Even though the empty set contains no items, the empty set is a subset of itself (and indeed every other set);</li>
    <li>Mathematicians generally do not universally agree on whether zero is a natural number, and textbooks will typically explicitly state whether or not the author considers zero to be a natural number.</li>
</ol>
"
What is Cardinality? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"The cardinality, or size, of a set is determined by the number of items in the set. The cardinality operator is given by a double pipe, <code>|...|</code>.

For example, if <code>S = { 1, 2, 4 }</code>, then <code>|S| = 3</code>."
What is the Empty Set? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"<ul align=""left"">
    <li>The empty set can be constructed in set builder notation using impossible conditions, e.g. <code>∅ = { x : x ≠ x }</code>, or <code>∅ = { x : x ∈ N, x < 0 }</code>;</li>
    <li>the empty set is always unique (i.e. there is one and only one empty set);</li>
    <li>the empty set is a subset of all sets;</li>
    <li>the cardinality of the empty set is 0, i.e. <code>|∅| = 0</code>.</li>
</ul>"
What are the ways of representing sets? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬Using literal Sets and Set builder notation
What are literal Sets? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"A set can be constructed literally by supplying a complete list of objects contained in the set. For example, <code>S = { a, b, c, d }</code>.

Long lists may be shortened with ellipses as long as the context is clear. For example, <code>E = { 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }</code> is clearly the set of all even numbers, containing an infinite number of objects, even though we've only explicitly written four of them."
What is Set Builder notation? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"Set builder notation is a more descriptive way of constructing a set. It relies on a _subject_ and a _predicate_ such that <code>S = { subject : predicate }</code>. For example,

<pre>
A = { x : x is a vowel } = { a, e, i, o, u, y}
B = { x : x ∈ N, x < 10 } = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }
C = { x : x = 2k, k ∈ N } = { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }
</pre>

Sometimes the predicate may ""leak"" into the subject, e.g.

<pre>
D = { 2x : x ∈ N } = { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... }
</pre>

What are some types or relations? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬Memberships & equalities
What is a membership? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"<ul align=""left"">
    <li>If the value <code>a</code> is contained in the set <code>A</code>, then we say <code>a</code> belongs to <code>A</code> and represent this symbolically as <code>a ∈ A</code>.</li>
    <li>If the value <code>a</code> is not contained in the set <code>A</code>, then we say <code>a</code> does not belong to <code>A</code> and represent this symbolically as <code>a ∉ A</code>.</li>
</ul>"
What is an equality? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"<ul align=""left"">
    <li>If two sets contain the same items then we say the sets are equal, e.g. <code>A = B</code>.</li>
    <li>Order does not matter when determining set equality, e.g. <code>{ 1, 2, 3, 4 } = { 2, 3, 1, 4 }</code>.</li>
    <li>Sets are disjoint, meaning elements cannot be repeated, e.g. <code>{ 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2 } = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }</code>.</li>
    <li>Two sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are equal if and only if <code>A ⊆ B</code> and <code>B ⊆ A</code>.</li>
</ul>"
What is an example of a special set? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬The Power Set
What is the Power Set? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"<ul align=""left"">
    <li>Let <code>A</code> be any set. The set that contains all possible subsets of <code>A</code> is called a ""power set"" and is written as <code>P(A)</code>. If the set <code>A</code> contains <code>n</code> elements, then <code>P(A)</code> contains <code>2^n</code> elements.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
P(A) = { x : x ⊆ A }

What is the Union among two sets? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"
Given two sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the union of the two sets are the items that appear in either <code>A</code> or <code>B</code>, written as <code>A ∪ B</code>.

<pre>
A ∪ B = { x : x ∈ A ∪ x ∈ B }
</pre>
"
What is the Intersection among two sets? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"
Given two sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the intersection of the two sets are the items that appear in both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, written as <code>A ∩ B</code>.

<pre>
A ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A, x ∈ B }
</pre>
"
What is the Difference among two sets? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"
Given two sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the set difference of <code>A</code> with <code>B</code> is every item in <code>A</code> that does not belong to <code>B</code>.

<pre>
A \ B = { x : x ∈ A, x ∉ B }
</pre>
"
What is the Symmetrical difference among two sets? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"
Given two sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the symmetrical difference is all items among <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> that doesn't appear in their intersections.

<pre>
A △ B = { x : ((x ∈ A) ∩ (x ∉ B)) ∪ ((x ∈ B) ∩ (x ∉ A)) }

A △ B = (A \ B) ∪ (B \ A)
</pre>
"
What is the Cartesian product among two sets? (Learn X in Y minutes Set theory)¬"
Given two sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the cartesian product between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> consists of a set containing all combinations of items of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.

<pre>
A × B = { (x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B }
</pre>
