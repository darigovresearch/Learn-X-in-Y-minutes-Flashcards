# Learn-X-in-Y-minutes-Flashcards
Repository containing Anki Flashcards &amp; source code to revise various programming languages

## Introduction
This repository has taken content outlined in the section for each topic from the [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) site and put them into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. All the content from each language has been arranged in a way that can be easily learnt from Anki, separated into decks for each programming language/topic.
2. Any updates, corrections or translations to the deck will be available at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/Learn-X-in-Y-minutes-Flashcards">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Learn-X-in-Y-minutes-Flashcards</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.
3. Modifications from the original work includes rearranging content to make it easier to learn/revise in Anki.

Feel free to share the decks and give the repository a star so more people are likely to see this work and can get the most out of it.

## Usage
If you want to just learn the words, download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> on your device of choice and open the .apkg file to add it into your collection. You can choose to download the whole texbook as a single deck or you can download it a chapter at a time from the individual chapter files in the "APKG" folder for the relevant language pair. If you wish to build the deck from scratch you will need to import the .txt file via the desktop with HTML enabled and the separator to be "|" unless another separator has been used.

## Potential Improvements Yet to be Made
1. To automatically generate flashcards from updates in the source files
2. To be able to automatically sort the cards so that the features which are used most in the page is displayed first for the user to learn.

## Contributing
Pull requests, corrections, translations & fixes are welcome. Any contributions must be submitted under the same license that the original piece of work (see below). Take a look at any open issues or submit new ones if there is something that needs to be fixed or added.

### Translating for other languages
Translations in all languages are welcome. Send a pull request or open an issue any time of day or night.

We're happy for any contribution in any form, but if you're making more than one major change (i.e. translations for two different languages) it would be super cool of you to make a separate pull request for each one so that someone can review them more effectively and/or individually.
