Introduction|"<p>This deck has taken content outlined in the SQL article from the <a href=""https://learnxinyminutes.com/"">Learn X in Y minutes</a> site and put them into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href=""https://apps.ankiweb.net/"">Anki</a> a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Please note the modifications which have been made &amp; where you can find updates.</p>
<ol align=""left"">
<li>All the content from each topic has been arranged in a way that can be easily learnt from Anki, separated into decks for each programming language/topic.</li>
<li>Any updates, corrections or translations to the deck will be available at <a href=""https://github.com/darigovresearch/Learn-X-in-Y-minutes-Flashcards"">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Learn-X-in-Y-minutes-Flashcards</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.</li>

What does each comment start with?|-- Comments start with two hyphens.
What does each command end with?|; Each command ends with a semicolon.
Is SQL case sensitive about key words?|No
What is the convention of typing commands in SQL?|The sample commands here follow the convention of spelling them in upper-case because it makes it easier to distinguish them from database, table, and column names.
How do you create a database?|CREATE DATABASE someDatabase;
How do you delete a database?|DROP DATABASE someDatabase;
Are database and table names case sensitive?|Database and table names are case-sensitive.
What is the command to list the available databases?|SHOW DATABASES;
What is the command to use a particular existing database?|USE employees;
What is the command to select all rows and columns from the current database's departments table?|SELECT * FROM departments;
What is the default activity for the interpreter to do with the results on your screen?|Default activity is for the interpreter to scroll the results on your screen.
How would you retrieve all rows from the departments table but only the dept_no and dept_name columns?|SELECT dept_no, dept_name FROM departments;
Is it okay to split up commands across lines?|Splitting up commands across lines is OK.
How would you retrieve all departments columns, but just 5 rows?|SELECT * FROM departments LIMIT 5;
How would you retrieve dept_name column values from the departments table where the dept_name value has the substring 'en'?|SELECT dept_name FROM departments WHERE dept_name LIKE '%en%';
How would you retrieve all columns from the departments table where the dept_name column starts with an 'S' and has exactly 4 characters after it?|SELECT * FROM departments WHERE dept_name LIKE 'S____';
How would you select title values from the titles table but not show duplicates?|SELECT DISTINCT title FROM titles;
How would you select title values from the titles table, not show duplicates but sorted (case-sensitive) by the title values?|SELECT DISTINCT title FROM titles ORDER BY title;
How would you show the number of rows in the departments table?|SELECT COUNT(*) FROM departments;
How would you show the number of rows in the departments table that have 'en' as a substring of the dept_name value?|SELECT COUNT(*) FROM departments WHERE dept_name LIKE '%en%';
How would you perform a JOIN of information from multiple tables: the titles table shows who had what job titles, by their employee numbers, from what date to what date. Retrieve this information, but instead of the employee number, use the employee number as a cross-reference to the employees table to get each employee's first and last name instead (and only get 10 rows)?|SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, <br>       titles.title, titles.from_date, titles.to_date <br>FROM titles INNER JOIN employees ON <br>       employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no LIMIT 10;
How would you list all the tables in all the databases?|SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE='BASE TABLE'; <br> Note that Implementations typically provide their own shortcut command to do this with the database currently in use.
How would you create a table called tablename1, with the two columns shown, for the database currently in use?|CREATE TABLE tablename1 (fname VARCHAR(20), lname VARCHAR(20)); <br>Note that lots of other options are available for how you specify the columns, such as their datatypes.
What is the command to insert a row of data into the table tablename1?|INSERT INTO tablename1 VALUES('Richard','Mutt'); <br>This assumes that the table has been defined to accept these values as appropriate for it.
How would you in tablename1, change the fname value to 'John' for all rows that have an lname value of 'Mutt'?|UPDATE tablename1 SET fname='John' WHERE lname='Mutt';
What would be the command to delete rows from the tablename1 table where the lname value begins with 'M'?|DELETE FROM tablename1 WHERE lname like 'M%';
How would you delete all rows from the tablename1 table, leaving the empty table?|DELETE FROM tablename1;
What would be the command to remove the entire tablename1 table?|DROP TABLE tablename1;
